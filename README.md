# Monodepth2

This repository contains the implementation of the methods described in

> **[Improving Self-Supervised Single View Depth Estimation by Masking Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11112)**

We introduce an occlusion mask, that during training specifically ignores regions that cannot be reconstructed due to occlusions and prevents them from being used in the supervisory signal.

The implementation is a modified version of [Monodepth2](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2).

## ‚öô Setup

You can refer to the [README](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2/blob/master/README.md) from the original project to setup the required environment.

## üñºÔ∏è Prediction for a single image

You can predict depth for a single image with:
```shell
python test_simple.py --image_path assets/test_image.jpg --model_name non_occluded_min_640x192
```

On its first run this will download the `non_occluded_min_640x192` pretrained model (99MB) into the `models/` folder.
We provide the following  options for `--model_name`:


| `--model_name`          | Photometric loss | Occlusion mask | Model resolution  | KITTI abs. rel. error |  delta < 1.25  |
|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------|----------------|
